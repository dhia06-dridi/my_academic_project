A mini-project focused on the design and development of a robotic welding arm, created using SolidWorks for mechanical modeling and MATLAB Simulink for dynamic simulation and control. The project also integrates a custom MATLAB GUI to facilitate user-friendly interaction and control of the robot. Additionally, it ensures seamless transfer of the SolidWorks model into MATLAB Simscape Multibody (formerly SimMechanics) for accurate kinematic and dynamic analysis, enabling precise simulation and optimization of the robotic system.
