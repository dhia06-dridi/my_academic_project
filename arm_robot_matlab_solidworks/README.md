# **Design and Control of a Welding Robotic Arm Using SolidWorks and MATLAB/Simulink**
This project aims to design a welding robotic arm by modeling its mechanical structure using SolidWorks. Once the design is complete, the movement and joint control will be managed using MATLAB/Simulink, with the development of a graphical user interface (GUI). This interface will enable intuitive control of the armâ€™s various joints, ensuring precise and efficient welding operations.
